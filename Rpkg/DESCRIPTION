Description: An English language syllable counter, plus readability score
    measure-er.  The package has been carefully optimized and should be very
    efficient, both in terms of run time performance and memory consumption.
    The main methods 'vectorized' by document, and scores for multiple documents
    are computed in parallel via 'OpenMP'.
