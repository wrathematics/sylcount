\title{sylcount: Syllable Counting and Readability Measurements}
\description{
An English language syllable counter, plus readability score measure-er. For
readability, we support Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
(Kincaid et al. 1975), Automated Readability Index (Senter and Smith 1967),
Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (McLaughlin 1969), and Coleman-Liau (Coleman
and Liau 1975). The package has been carefully optimized and should be very
efficient, both in terms of run time performance and memory consumption. The
main methods are vectorized by document, and scores for multiple documents
are computed in parallel via OpenMP.
