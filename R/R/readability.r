#' readability
#' 
#' @description
#' Computes some basic "readability" measurements, includeing Flesch Reading
#' Ease, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Automatic Readability Index, and the
#' Simple Measure of Gobbledygook.  The function is vectorized by document, and
#' scores are computed in parallel via OpenMP.  You can control the number of
#' threads used with the \code{nthreads} parameter.
#' 
#' The function will have some difficulty on poorly processed and cleaned data.
#' For example, if all punctuation is stripped out, then the number of sentences
#' detected will always be zero.  However, we do recommend removing quotes
#' (single and double), as contractions can confuse the parser.
#' 
#' @details
#' The return is split into words and non-words.  A non-word is some block
#' of text more than 64 characters long with no spaces or sentence-ending
#' punctuation inbetween.  The number of non-words is returned mostly
#' for error-checking/debugging purposes.  If you have a lot of 
#' non-words, you probably didn't clean your text properly.  The word/non-word
#' division is made in an attempt to improve run-time and memory performance.
#' 
#' For implementation details, see the Details section of \code{?sylcount}.

#' @return
#' A dataframe containing:

#'   \code{chars}     \tab the total numberof characters \cr
#'   \code{wordchars} \tab the number of alphanumeric characters \cr
#'   \code{words}     \tab text tokens that are probably English language words \cr
#'   \code{nonwords}  \tab text tokens that are probably not English language words \cr
#'   \code{sents}     \tab the number of sentences recognized in the text \cr
#'   \code{sylls}     \tab the total number of syllables (ignores all non-words) \cr
#'   \code{polys}     \tab the total number of "polysyllables", or words with 3+ syllables \cr
#'   \code{re}        \tab Flesch reading ease score \cr

#' @param s
#' A character vector (vector of strings).
#' @param nthreads
#' Number of threads to use. By default it will use the total number of
#' cores + hyperthreads.
